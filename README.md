# Todo

A basic to-do list application with an input field and a submit button to add new tasks.Styled the to-do list items, including completed tasks (e.g., strike-through completed tasks).
Implemented functionality to add, remove, and mark tasks as completed. Store the tasks in the local storage so that they persist after refreshing the page.
Added a filter feature to display all, completed, or incomplete tasks.
Implemented a drag-and-drop feature to reorder the tasks.
